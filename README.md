# ðŸ§  Energy Landscape Modeling of Brain Dynamics
This repository implements the method for analyzing binarized brain network time series using a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM) and energy landscape analysis, following [Brain network dynamics in high-functioning individuals with autism](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16048) studies.


## You can implement the code with any time series data.
